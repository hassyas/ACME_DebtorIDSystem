# Introduction of Code
This is a Python-based Debtor Identification System known as "ACME Debtor Identification System." This system allows users to manage debtor information efficiently. It includes features for reading, adding, updating, and deleting debtor records in a database.

# Summary of Code Flow from main.py
The uploaded code is a Python program for a Debtor Identification System. It allows users to manage debtor information through a console-based interface. Here's a summary of its flow:

1. The code imports necessary modules, including the `os` module for screen clearing and a custom module named `CRUD` for database operations.

2. It initializes a global flag `clear_needed` to control screen clearing.

3. The `clear_screen` function clears the console screen based on the operating system (Unix/Linux/Mac or Windows).

4. The `main_menu` function displays the main menu options, including reading, adding, updating, or deleting debtor records, and exiting the program. It also manages screen clearing.

5. The program defines sub-menus for reading, adding, updating, and deleting debtor records. Each sub-menu handles its specific functionality and can loop until the user decides to return to the main menu.

6. The `main` function is the program's entry point. It initializes the system, displays a welcome message, and checks if the database is available using functions from the `CRUD` module.

7. The main loop in the `main` function continuously displays the main menu, takes user input, and routes the user to the appropriate sub-menu or exits the program based on their choice.

8. The `if __name__ == "__main__"` block ensures that the `main` function is executed when the script is run.

In summary, the code provides a console-based interface for managing debtor records, including reading, adding, updating, and deleting records, with clear screen functionality and a user-friendly menu system. It relies on the `CRUD` module for database operations.
